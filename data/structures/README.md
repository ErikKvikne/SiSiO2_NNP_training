# Selected Structures

## asio2

Last 80 frames (80 ps) of the melt-quench simulations. Each structure started from the same inital structure, with different random velocity initialization.

## interfaces

Final interfaces of after melting SiO2 and cooling the structure. Three facets (100), (110) and (111) with 10 final structures per facet.

## oxygen_diffusion_initial

Trajectories for the initial oxygen diffusion simulation with preliminary model.

## oxygen_diffusion_refined_model

Trajectories for oxygen diffusion simulations with refined model.
