# Trained Models

This folder contains the DeepMD models used in the master's thesis to simulate Si/SiO₂ systems. Two generations of models are included: one based on the preliminary dataset, and one trained after dataset expansion using model deviation and oxygen diffusion sampling.

## `preliminary_dataset_model/`

This directory contains the first generation model trained on the initial dataset developed during the specialization project. The dataset is located at:
```
data/deepmd_dataset/preliminary_dataset/
```

### Contents:
- `25-03-11_long_run_model.pb`  
  Main model trained on the full preliminary dataset.

- `original_set_seed/`  
  Contains four models trained using the same data but with different random seeds. These were used to assess model variability and perform model deviation studies.

## `oxygen_diffusion_model/`

This directory contains the final DeepMD model trained on an expanded dataset. Additional data was generated by:
- Running model deviation–based sampling using the preliminary models.
- Sampling structures exhibiting oxygen diffusion events.

The combined dataset is located in:
```
data/deepmd_dataset/model_devi_additions/
data/deepmd_dataset/oxygen_jumps/
```

### Contents:
- `25-05-13_model_oxygen_diffusion_main.pb`  
  Final model used in production simulations throughout the thesis.

- `random_seed/`  
  Contains seeded variations of the final model, useful for future model deviation studies.

All models use the TensorFlow `.pb` format and were trained using consistent settings documented in the thesis. The seeded models provide a means to assess uncertainty and robustness across different random initializations.
